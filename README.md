### Good morning to everyone but especially those who found my github

**Interesting Projects**
* üè´ I built an *ASP.NET Core app* as a tool to store/distribute student license keys for [Mohawk College](https://mohawkcollege.ca). It's a back-up plan for the unlikely scenario of Azure for Students getting dropped, but it was a cool learning project. Visit it at https://github.com/emulrooney/msl-mohawk.
* üé® *hamArtsMap* is a LAMP stack app I built in my front-end development class to showcase public art and museums in the city of Hamilton. It's not online anymore, but I have a video demo on the repo at https://github.com/emulrooney/hamArtsMap.
* üéÆ I do a bit of game dev on the side. My team won **Best Overall Game** at Mohawk's first ever game jam for [Pangolin Dinner](https://github.com/emulrooney/PangolinGameJam), but I'm most proud of [Orbital4](https://github.com/emulrooney/Orbital4) which is a Java implementation of Connect4 in four directions. I also tried to replicate the control scheme of real-time with pause RPGs like Baldur's Gate in Godot, which you can see in video format in the [Godot-RTWP repo](https://github.com/emulrooney/godot-RTWP). Finally, I entered [Beelancer](https://github.com/emulrooney/beelancer) into Github's [Gameoff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).
* üê≤ I built a Dungeons & Dragons aid to show character abilities and notes in a nice masonry-style grid. it's called [Dungeonwall](https://github.com/emulrooney/dungeonwall). It's probably done for now - shelved while my current campaign is on hold. 

Finally, my [portfolio](https://emulrooney.github.io) is up-to-date and has more comprehensive information including education and work history. Freshly re-done in Jekyll.
