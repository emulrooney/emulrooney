### Good morning to everyone but especially those who found my github

**Recent Work**
* 🏫 I built an *ASP.NET Core app* as a tool to store/distribute student license keys for [Mohawk College](https://mohawkcollege.ca). It's a back-up plan for an unlikely scenario, but it was a cool learning project. Visit it at https://github.com/emulrooney/msl-mohawk.
* 🎨 *hamArtsMap* is a LAMP stack app I built in my front-end development class to showcase public art and museums in the city of Hamilton. It's not online, but I have a video demo on the repo at https://github.com/emulrooney/hamArtsMap.
* 🎮 I build games for fun and extra learning! My team won **Best Overall Game** at Mohawk's first ever game jam for [Pangolin Dinner](https://github.com/emulrooney/PangolinGameJam), but I'm more proud of [Orbital4](https://github.com/emulrooney/Orbital4) which is a Java implementation of Connect4 in four directions. I also tried to replicate the control scheme of real-time with pause RPGs like Baldur's Gate in Godot, which you can see in video format in the [Godot-RTWP repo](https://github.com/emulrooney/godot-RTWP).
* 🐲 Last but not least, I'm working on a Dungeons & Dragons aid to show character abilities and notes in a nice masonry style grid... that'll be linked soon.

Finally, my [portfolio](https://emulrooney.github.io) is reasonably up-to-date and has more comprehensive information.
