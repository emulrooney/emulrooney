### Good morning to everyone but especially those who found my github

**Interesting projects**
* üéÆ I do a bit of game dev on the side. My most recent finished project is [Beelancer](https://github.com/emulrooney/beelancer), an entry into Github's [Gameoff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021). As a student, my team won **Best Overall Game** at Mohawk's first ever game jam for [Pangolin Dinner](https://github.com/emulrooney/PangolinGameJam), but I'm most proud of [Orbital4](https://github.com/emulrooney/Orbital4) which is a Java implementation of Connect4 in four directions. I also had a project to replicate the control scheme of real-time with pause RPGs like Baldur's Gate 1/2 in [Godot](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/), which you can see in video format in the [Godot-RTWP repo](https://github.com/emulrooney/godot-RTWP).
* üê≤ I built a Dungeons & Dragons aid to show character abilities and notes in a nice masonry-style grid. it's called [Dungeonwall](https://github.com/emulrooney/dungeonwall). It's done for now - it got some real use back when I was playing a campaign, but since that's been on hold I haven't felt like touching it. It uses Vue and MongoDB mostly.
* üé® *hamArtsMap* is a fairly simple LAMP stack app I built at [Mohawk College](https://www.mohawkcollege.ca/) to showcase public art and museums in the city of Hamilton, leveraging Bing maps. It's not online anymore, but I have a video demo on the [hamArtsMap repo](https://github.com/emulrooney/hamArtsMap).

Finally, my [portfolio](https://evanmulrooney.dev) is up-to-date and has more comprehensive information including education and work history. Freshly re-done in Next.js with Pico CSS.
